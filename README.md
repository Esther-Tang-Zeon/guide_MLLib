## Suggestions

1. Use this template repo to create your training repo as _guide\_[topic]_
2. Make sure your training repo is set as a template repo.
3. Delete the text from `README.md` and replace it with your training material.
4. Consider using presentation slides in your training (Read (remark.md)[remark.md] for more help).
    - Leverage `index.html`
    - Use GitHub Pages: `Settings > Pages`. Set source `main` and `\(root)`.
5. Make sure that a user can use your template repo to see example scripts and have a standardized environment.
6. Provide any additional files needed in the subfolders of the repository.

### Goals

- Leave the participants with working examples.
- Have documented instructions and references for further learning.
- Cite experts based on your research.
- Make sure your entire team contributes.
